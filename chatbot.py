con="""Abhishek: Good afternoon, Officer. I'm Abhishek Roy, and I need to report a theft that occurred during my journey from New Delhi to Jalandhar on the Paschim Express.

Police Officer: Good afternoon, Mr. Roy. I'm Officer Sharma. I'm here to assist you. Please, have a seat. Could you provide me with all the details regarding the incident?

Abhishek: Certainly, Officer Sharma. So, while I was traveling on the Paschim Express, I realized that my luggage had been stolen.

Police Officer: I see. Can you tell me when you first noticed that your luggage was missing?

Abhishek: Yes, I realized it was missing shortly after we departed from New Delhi station. I had stored my luggage in the overhead compartment of the train. But when I went to retrieve it later, it was nowhere to be found.

Police Officer: Did you notice anyone acting suspiciously or any unusual activity during the journey?

Abhishek: No, Officer. I didn't observe anything out of the ordinary. It seems like the theft must have occurred when I momentarily left my seat.

Police Officer: Alright. Can you provide me with a detailed description of your luggage? Any distinctive features or items inside that could help us identify it?

Abhishek: Certainly. It's a black suitcase with a red stripe along the side. Inside, there are mainly clothes, toiletries, and some personal items. Additionally, I had my laptop, a few pieces of jewelry, and important documents like my passport and ID card in the suitcase.

Police Officer: Thank you for the detailed description, Mr. Roy. We'll make sure to include all these items in the report. Did you notice any specific individuals or groups behaving suspiciously in the vicinity of your seat or the overhead compartment?

Abhishek: No, Officer. I didn't notice anything unusual or any suspicious individuals around me during the journey.

Police Officer: Understood. We'll need you to fill out a formal report with all these details. Additionally, we'll conduct further investigations and check CCTV footage if available. Please come with me to the station, and we'll get started on the process.

Abhishek: Thank you, Officer Sharma. I really appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Police Officer: You're welcome, Mr. Roy. We'll do everything in our power to recover your belongings. Let's head to the station and get the report filed."""
